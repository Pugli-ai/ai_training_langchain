# AI Training - Langchain Basics
In this repo you would find the notebook (`langchain_basics.ipynb`) that contains the basics of Langchain. The notebook is a step-by-step guide to interact with LLMs using langchain.

You would also find a small application implemented with [gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) that uses langchain to generate traveling advice.
